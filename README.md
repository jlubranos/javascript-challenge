## UFO-level-1:
####    This program contains the level one search which was assigned in the homework instructions.  D3 methods were
####    used to accomplish this.  I noticed that if the user hits the return button the whole page reloads.  The program
####    checks for the return keycode and just reloads the table instead of reloading the whole page.



## UFO-level-2:
 ####   This program has 5 drop down options the user can choose from.  The choices for each of those drop downs are
 ####   created according to the data list provided.  Each list contains unique options to choose from in sorted order
 ####   with the exception of the date dropdown.  Due to the format of the dates provided the sort will not completely
 ####   sort dates in ascending order.  When the user chooses all the options desired click the submit button and the 
 ####   program displays results if any.  This program utilizes a combination of D3 and JavaScript methods.
